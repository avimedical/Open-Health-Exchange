# Project Progress: Health Data Sync Micro-service

## What works
- Project documentation setup: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md` files created and populated.
- High-level architecture and technology stack defined.
- Initial planning for Django app structure and API design completed.
- Renamed Django apps: `devices` to `base`, `fetch_data` to `ingestors`, `transform_data` to `transformers`, and `push_fhir_data` to `publishers`.
- Updated `INSTALLED_APPS` in `open_health_exchange/settings.py`.
- Renamed `ProviderCredentials` model to `ProviderLink` (already done).
- Removed `DeviceConfiguration` model and related ViewSets.
- Basic file structure (models.py, views.py, serializers.py, urls.py, admin.py) created for all apps.
- Defined `Provider` and `ProviderLink` models in `base` app.
- Implemented initial API endpoints for Provider in `base` app.
- Integrated Black and Flake8 code formatting and linting (added as dev dependencies).
- Integrated Huey and Redis task queue.
- Integrated python-social-auth for OAuth2 implementation.
- OAuth2 flow implementation is complete using custom pipelines in `base/pipeline.py`.
- Implemented initial OAuth2 flow initiation and callback handling in `ProviderLinkViewSet` in `base/views.py`.
- Moved user association logic to custom pipelines in `base/pipeline.py`.
- Updated root URLconf in `open_health_exchange/urls.py` to include base URLs under `/api/base/` path.
- Configured API versioning to use AcceptHeaderVersioning.
- Reset migrations and applied new migrations to resolve `InconsistentMigrationHistory` error.
- Development server is running successfully.
- Social login works for Withings and Fitbit.

## What's left to build
- Define initial tasks for data fetching in the `ingestors` app using Huey.
- Data transformation and FHIR push logic in respective apps.
- Metrics collection and Prometheus integration.
- Authentication implementation (OAuth2, JWT).
- Kubernetes deployment configurations.
- UI development (separate project).
- Testing (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- Documentation (API, development, deployment).

## Current status
- Project planning, documentation, basic app setup, Django app renaming and configuration, model and ViewSet cleanup, and URL updates are complete.
- Migrations reset and applied successfully, and development server is running.
- Huey and Redis task queue integrated.
- Code formatting and linting tools are integrated.
- python-social-auth library is integrated for OAuth2.
- OAuth2 flow implementation is complete and social login works for Withings and Fitbit.
- Ready to implement FHIR Device creation and Device Management API endpoints.

## Known issues
- None at this stage.

## Next Milestone
- Implement FHIR Device creation and Device Management API endpoints.
