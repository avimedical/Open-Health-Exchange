# Product Context: Health Data Sync Micro-service

## Why this project exists?
This project aims to create a seamless bridge between personal health data collected by wearable devices and Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems used by healthcare providers. By automatically synchronizing data from popular third-party providers like Withings, Fitbit, Omron, and Beurer into a FHIR R5 compliant EHR, we can solve the problem of fragmented health information and empower both patients and providers with a more holistic view of health data.

## Problems it solves?
- **Data Silos:** Health data is often scattered across various apps and devices, making it difficult to get a unified view. This micro-service breaks down these silos by aggregating data from different sources.
- **Lack of EHR Integration:**  Wearable data is rarely integrated into EHR systems, limiting its utility in clinical settings. This project directly addresses this by providing a standardized FHIR R5 interface for wearable data in EHRs.
- **Manual Data Entry:**  Currently, patients or providers must manually enter wearable data into EHRs, which is inefficient and prone to errors. Automation of this process is a key benefit.
- **Limited Access to Patient-Generated Health Data:** Healthcare providers often lack access to valuable patient-generated health data that could inform treatment decisions and improve patient care. This service provides a channel for this data to flow into the EHR.

## How it should work?
The micro-service will act as a middleware, allowing users to:
1. **Configure Connections:** Users will securely configure connections to their accounts with third-party health data providers (e.g., Withings, Fitbit) and their FHIR R5 EHR system. This involves managing credentials and authentication (ideally OAuth2).
2. **Automated Data Fetching:**  The service will periodically fetch health data from the configured third-party providers using their APIs.
3. **Data Transformation and Mapping:**  Data from each provider will be transformed and mapped into standardized FHIR R5 resources (e.g., Observation, Device, etc.). Configurable mappings may be needed to handle variations in data models.
4. **FHIR R5 Data Push:** The transformed FHIR R5 resources will be pushed to the configured EHR system via its FHIR API. Duplicate detection mechanisms will be implemented to avoid data redundancy.
5. **Background Synchronization:** Cron jobs will ensure regular data synchronization, capturing any data missed during normal operation and ensuring data freshness.
6. **Monitoring and Metrics:** The service will expose metrics (e.g., sync status, queue lengths, errors) for monitoring and integration with Prometheus, enabling operational oversight and performance analysis.

## User experience goals?
- **Simple Configuration:**  The configuration process for connecting providers and EHR systems should be intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Secure and Private:** User credentials and health data must be handled securely, respecting user privacy and complying with relevant regulations.
- **Reliable and Robust:** The service should operate reliably in the background, ensuring consistent and accurate data synchronization.
- **Transparent Monitoring:**  Users and operators should have visibility into the service's operation through metrics and logs, allowing for easy troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
- **Minimal Maintenance:** The service should be designed for low maintenance, with automated processes and clear error handling.
